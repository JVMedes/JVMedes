# Welcome to my Website's Repository

       As you may expect, this is my website and an extension of my resume for a programming job. 
    Here, I demonstrate what I am capable of and what I have already done. You can analyze what 
    I'm up to and have a basic understanding of my work. 

       It is a pleasure to have you looking at my work. Hope you find it interesting :)
